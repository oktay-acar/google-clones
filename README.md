# Google Homepage Clones

## Description

This repository contains two versions of Googleâ€™s homepage clone:

1. **Google 1998 Homepage Clone**: A simple reproduction of Google's homepage as it appeared in 1998 using basic HTML and CSS.
2. **Modernized Google Homepage Clone**: An updated version that modernizes the 1998 clone with contemporary HTML and CSS practices while preserving the original aesthetic.

This solution was implemented as part of a project during the **Beginner Frontend Web Development Path**, offered by [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/), where I applied my own unique approaches and methods.

Details are provided in the individual **README** files within each folder.
